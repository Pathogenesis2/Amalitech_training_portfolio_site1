Do not change location of resources, it will affect 
performance.

# Disclaimer
The site works fine on all platforms and that's great,
one problem I still face and is trying to solve is why 
picture grid in the middle fail to apply its margin top
rule when being displayed on an iPhone x. What is going
on? Feel free to leave your comments I will be glad you 
did. Oops and least I forget, the buttons perform no action
yet.
